## Prompt

## Response snapshot

Updated the project constitution to reflect the VIP Constitution for the Spec-Driven Agentic AI Todo System. The new constitution emphasizes specification-first design, instruction-based agent architecture, and clear hierarchy. Updated template files to align with the new constitution, including plan-template.md, spec-template.md, and tasks-template.md. The constitution now properly reflects the Phase 1 focus on design clarity, agent roles, and specifications.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Project constitution updated with VIP Spec-Driven Agentic AI Todo System principles
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: 4 files updated to maintain consistency with new constitution
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed with feature specification based on updated constitution
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution now properly reflects the VIP system and provides clear governance guidelines for Phase 1
